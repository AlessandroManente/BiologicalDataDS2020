This file will contain all the .out files that the TMalign program will generate.
Since they are a lot of files, we store them temporarly in this folder just to read them.
Once we finish reading, we delete them and store the data in 2 separate .csv files:
1) rmsds_{modelname}
2) tmscores_{modelname}
